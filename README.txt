X = Done / Completed

-- Parts --
X - Surface Mounted tanks - 2 types Box & Tank
X - Cyl (stack) Tanks - No bigger than reaction wheels, type with releasable shroud
X - More Generators for the tank, made 2 Gas & Liquid processing
Not Needed - Spherical Tank - Similar to Surface tanks

Sources - All blender files and layer textures used for the parts listed by folders.
-----Note: Blender files utilize a plugin called TexTools, I used this for baking diffuse maps.

Unity - Unity setup for exporting the parts out to the game.

Compiled - KSP Ready files with some example scripts. (Scripts may be old and not relevant to current Kerbalism setup: Suggested Do not use)
